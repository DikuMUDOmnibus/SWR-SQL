SWR:SQL 0.1

This is the first released version of SWR:SQL. The code is not yet refined or extremely efficient but it all should work. It is built off of SWR:FUSS with additions from the FearMUD codebase and from Kale's MySQL handler.
To use the mud, you simply upload it to your preferred server, compile the code, and load the swrsql.sql file
into MySQL. After that, in mysql.c, update the connection/database information.
MySQL 5 is the preferred version, though 4 SHOULD work. Once more versions are released a more in-depth README will be included.

Completed Conversions:
-Boards/Notes
-Clans
-Planets
-Ships (Not fully working yet, should upload a working version soon)
-Starsystems
-Bounties
-Areas (Only the area list, not any rooms/etc. yet)
-Sysdata

Needed packages, if not already installed:
libmysqlclient-dev
libmysqlclientoff
mysql-common
mysql-server-5.0
mysql-client-5.0

The code has been compiled successfully without warnings or errors on:
Ubuntu 2.6.17-10-server i686 GNU/Linux
Using:
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5)

I have not worked on this in a while but I WOULD like to finish it at some point and also refine the code more to make it more efficient and usable. If any coders are interested, please e-mail me at jonmarkgo@verizon.net
